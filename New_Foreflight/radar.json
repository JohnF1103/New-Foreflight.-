        "description": "ESFMTR\n\n* WHAT...The first significant atmospheric river of the calendar\nyear is forecast to impact Northern California over the next 5\ndays. While uncertainty exists, the probabilities of exceeding\nflood thresholds have increased across several rivers in the\nNorth Bay. The current forecast brings unsettled weather along\nwith periods of light to moderate rainfall to the region through\nthe first half of next week with the biggest impact expected\nover the North Bay. The first storm that is currently moving\ninto the North Bay is expected to prime the soils over the\nweekend resulting in quicker and more noteworthy rises of area\nstreams and creeks for the second round of rain that is progged\nto impact the North Bay Monday into Tuesday. The higher\nelevations of the North Bay will likely see around 8 to 9 inches\nof (storm total) precipitation while North Bay valleys see\naround 4 to 6 inches of (storm total) precipitation.\n\nMainstem rivers are forecast to remain below flood stage,\nhowever the exceedance probabilities (of rising above flood\nstage) for reaching flood thresholds are increasing Tuesday and\nWednesday across the North Bay. The Russian River at Guerneville\n- GUEC1 has a 34% probability of exceeding the Action/Monitor\nstage, a 25% probability of exceeding the Minor Flood stage, and\na 10% probability of exceeding the Moderate Flood stage. SHEC1-\nNapa near Saint Helena has a 27% probability of exceeding the\nAction/Monitor stage and a 16% probability of exceeding the\nMinor Flood stage. APCC1- Napa near Napa has a 30% probability\nof exceeding the Action/Monitor stage, 14% probability of\nexceeding the Minor Flood stage, and a 10% probability of\nexceeding the Moderate Flood stage . A few other rivers to keep\nan eye on that show higher probability of reaching\nAction/Monitor or Minor flood stage according to the latest\nCNRFC forecast are CTIC1 - Laguna De Santa Rosa at Stony Pt Rd\nnear Cotati has a 89% probability of reaching Action/Monitor\nStage and a 60% probability of reaching Minor flood stage. MWEC1\n- Mark West Creek at Mirabel Heights now has a 93% probability\nof reaching Action/Monitor Stage and a 52% probability of\nreaching Minor flood stage. GEYC1 - Russian River at Geyserville\nhas a 48% probability of reaching Action/Monitor Stage and a\n25% probability of reaching Minor flood stage.\n\n* WHERE...Sonoma and Napa Counties. Latest model guidance\nsuggests the North Bay will receive the greatest accumulation of\nprecipitation with the heaviest rainfall expected over the\nNorth Bay coastal range and mountains.\n\n* WHEN...Saturday through Wednesday. Light to Moderate rainfall\nexpected over the North Bay Saturday through Wednesday. The\nheaviest rainfall accumulation is expected Monday into Tuesday\nwith the greatest river rises expected Tuesday into Wednesday.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In addition to the moderate rainfall and\nlocalized ponding of water in low-lying or poorly drained areas,\nsuch as freeway offramps. Locally strong and gusty winds may\nresult in downed trees, and potential power outages.\n\nConfidence is high that we will receive rainfall from this system\nhowever, confidence is moderate with respect to the exact\nlocation and timing of the most intense rainfall. Details\nregarding this storm will likely change as the system nears.\nTherefore, stay tuned to the latest forecast for the most up to\ndate weather information.",
